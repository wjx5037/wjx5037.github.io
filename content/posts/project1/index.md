## Research approach
During the research and development process, my main contributions included CAD modeling design related to the project structure and corresponding motion simulation analysis. Additionally, I was responsible for writing and submitting the national invention patent for "A Forklift Attachment for Handling and Installing Hollow Concrete Barriers."

By reviewing and analyzing domestic and international literature and technical materials on highway barriers, vacuum lifting technology, multi-degree-of-freedom robotic arms, and intelligent equipment, I proposed the "transverse gripping" solution to address the handling problem of hollow concrete barriers. Using SolidWorks, I conducted CAD design and simulation analysis of the model. I also took responsibility for writing and submitting the national invention patent for "A Forklift Attachment for Handling and Installing Hollow Concrete Barriers" to protect intellectual property.

## Specific design process
Regarding the "transverse gripping" solution for handling hollow concrete barriers, I used SolidWorks for CAD design, which included a fork frame connection, horizontal movement device, supporting lower arm, supporting upper arm, two connecting arms, an adaptive device, and two cylinders for horizontal movement and gripping. The fork frame connection is attached to the forklift's fork frame, and the horizontal movement device is connected to the fork frame via linear bearings. The supporting lower and upper arms and the connecting arms are connected to the horizontal movement device through hinges, allowing horizontal translation of the attachment. The supporting lower and upper arms, along with the connecting arms, form a parallelogram structure, enabling the gripping of concrete barriers through the extension and retraction of the gripping cylinders. When the supporting lower arm is inserted into the hollow concrete barrier, and the indicator protrusion on the lower arm aligns with the center hole of the hollow concrete barrier, retracting the gripping cylinders allows the upper and lower arms to grip the concrete barrier. The adaptive device on the upper arm automatically adjusts to the surface angle of the hollow concrete barrier and grips the barrier, facilitating the handling and installation of the barrier. Additionally, the upper surface of the supporting lower arm and the bottom of the adaptive device are equipped with rubber cushioning layers to ensure flexible contact between the attachment and the concrete barrier, reducing the risk of barrier damage. This invention's mechanized design makes the handling and installation of hollow concrete barriers more efficient and safer, reducing operational difficulty and labor intensity while minimizing the risk of barrier damage. The attachment has a simple overall structure, easy to manufacture and maintain, significantly enhancing work efficiency and meeting modern construction needs.


## Invention Description of “transverse gripping” solution

The objective of this invention is to provide a forklift attachment for handling and installing hollow concrete barriers. This attachment can move horizontally, has a simple and convenient structure, meets normal operational requirements, solves the problems associated with handling and installing hollow concrete barriers, improves work efficiency, and addresses safety hazards.

To achieve the above objective, the solution provided by this invention is:

## Specific embodiments
The present invention is described in further detail below in connection with the accompanying drawings and specific embodiments:
As shown in FIGS. 1 to 9, a forklift attachment for handling and installing a hollow concrete guardrail comprises a forklift frame 7; a horizontal moving device 1; 2 connecting arms 2; a load-bearing lower arm 10; an adaptor 6; a horizontal moving cylinder cylinder 8; a horizontal moving cylinder piston rod 9; a clamping cylinder cylinder 4; and a clamping cylinder piston rod 5. As shown in FIG. 1, the light rod 15 on the fork carrier connecting frame 7 and the linear bearing assembly hole 14 on the horizontal moving device 1 are mated and connected in a linear bearing manner, and the pin hole 12 on the fork carrier connecting frame 7 is connected with the pin hole 33 on the cylinder barrel 8 of the one horizontally moving cylinder in a pin manner, and then the pin hole 18 on the horizontal moving device 1 is connected with the pin hole 34 on the piston rod 9 of the one horizontally moving cylinder in a pin manner. The pin holes 34 are connected in the manner of pins, and then said horizontally moving cylinder barrel 8 is assembled with a horizontally moving cylinder piston rod 9. Connecting the bolt holes 13 on the horizontal moving device 1 with the bolt holes 21 on the 2 connecting arms 2 by means of a bolt plus a bushing and two nuts fixing. Connect the pin holes 20 at the lower end of the horizontal moving device with the clamping cylinder barrel 4 by means of a pin, while the pin holes 28 on the load-bearing lower arm 10 connect the clamping cylinder piston rod 5, and then assemble said clamping cylinder barrel 4 with the clamping cylinder piston rod 5.


Connecting the bolt holes 22 on the two connecting arms 2 with the bolt holes 29 on the load-bearing lower arm 10 by means of a bolt plus a bushing and two nuts for fixing. Connect the bolt holes 19 on the horizontal moving device 1 with the bolt holes 25 and 26 on the upper arm 3 by means of one bolt plus a bushing and two nuts fixing. Connecting the bolt holes 30 on the load-bearing lower arm 10 with the bolt holes 24 and 27 on the upper arm 3 by means of a bolt plus a bushing and two nuts fixing. The pin holes 23 on said upper arm 3 are connected to the adaptor pin holes 31 by means of pin fixing.


As shown in Fig. 1, when the assembly of the horizontal moving cylinder barrel 8 and the horizontal moving cylinder barrel 9 is completed, the horizontal moving device 1 will translate to the right when the horizontal cylinder is extended, thus driving the 2 connecting arms 2, the upper arm 3, the load-bearing lower arm 10 and the adaptor 6 to the right. Similarly, when the leveling cylinder is shortened, the leveling device 1 will translate to the left, thus driving the 2 connecting arms 2, the upper arm 3, the load-bearing lower arm 10 and the adaptor 6 to the left. Upon completion of the assembly of the clamp cylinder barrel 4 and the clamp cylinder piston rod 5, the vertical cylinder, when extended, will rotate the 2 connecting arms 2 around the bolt holes 13 in a counterclockwise direction, and the upper arm 3, and the adaptor 6 will rotate around the bolt holes 19 at the same angle in a counterclockwise direction. At the same time, the lower arm 10 will make a slight movement upwards. At this point the angle between the load bearing lower arm 10 and the upper arm 3 will increase, as shown in Figure 10. The operator can then drive the forklift to insert the load-bearing lower arm 10 into the side of the hollow concrete guardrail, and when the protrusion on the load-bearing lower arm 10 is aligned with the middle opening of the hollow concrete guardrail, as shown in FIG. 11, the vertical cylinder can be controlled to shorten, so that the 2 connecting arms 2 will rotate around the bolt holes 13 in a clockwise direction, and the upper arm 3, and the adaptor 6, will rotate around the bolt holes 19 in a clockwise direction at the the same angle. At the same time, the lower arm 10 will make a slight movement downwards. The angle between the load bearing lower arm 10 and the upper arm 3 will decrease until the adaptor 6 and the load bearing lower arm 10 are securely clamped to the hollow concrete guardrail, as shown in Figure 12. At this point the operator can drive the forklift to move the hollow concrete fence to the designated location. The installation can then be completed by performing the opposite operation to securely remove the hollow concrete guardrail from the load-bearing lower arm 10.

## Fabrication method
The structural design of the fork rack connecting frame 7 is shown in Fig. 2. Due to the complex working environment of this equipment and the heavy hollow concrete guardrail, the fork rack connecting frame is often subjected to large forces. Therefore, the structure is welded by 3 pieces of carbon steel plate and 1 piece of carbon steel beam, and a solid carbon steel beam is welded in the center to prevent the structure from deformation. Two light rods are mounted on the upper part of the frame to facilitate assembly with the linear bearing holes on the horizontal moving unit. In addition, two cylinder connectors were welded to the carbon steel plate on the side.


As shown in Fig. 3, the horizontal moving device is mainly made of a center carbon steel beam and four pieces of carbon steel plates welded together, and two cylinder connectors are welded on its side and front for connecting the cylinders. In its upper carbon steel plate welded on the linear bearing connection holes, and the linear bearing is installed in it.


As shown in Fig. 4, the connecting arm is made of carbon steel plate and holes are cut at its ends for connecting bolts.


As shown in Fig. 5, the upper arm is made up of cut carbon steel plate, and because of the lightweight requirement, weight reduction slots as well as round holes are cut in the upper arm. Also, pin holes for connecting the adaptor and bolt holes for connecting the load-bearing lower arm to the horizontal movement device are cut on the side.


As shown in Figure 6, the lower arm is made of two carbon steel beams welded together to form an “L” shape. Three triangular carbon steel plates are welded to the two carbon steel beams to prevent deformation of the arm. At the same time, two cylinder connectors are welded on the vertical carbon steel beam to connect the cylinders. At the same time, drill holes in the vertical carbon steel beam to connect the bolts. And weld iron casting long bar protrusions on the horizontal carbon steel beam so that it can be aligned with the center hollow hole of the hollow concrete guardrail when handling and installing the hollow concrete guardrail. A rubber cushion is also installed on the horizontal carbon steel beam to prevent indentation and abrasion.


As shown in Fig. 7, the adaptor is mainly made of three carbon steel plates welded to each other, and the weight reduction holes are opened on the two vertical carbon steel plates to achieve the purpose of weight reduction. Holes are punched in the two vertical trapezoidal carbon steel plates for attachment of bolts.
