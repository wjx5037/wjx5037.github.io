The project aims to develop an intelligent integrated tunnel lighting cleaning operation platform, leveraging advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and intelligent control. This platform is designed to automate the cleaning and maintenance of tunnel lighting facilities, enhancing cleaning efficiency, reducing operational costs, and ensuring driving safety. My contributions involved CAD modeling and motion simulation analysis of the project structure. I proposed the "mechanical extension arm" solution for tunnel lighting cleaning, utilizing SolidWorks for design and simulation. The design features three mechanical arms, a rotating connection platform, and a cleaning spray platform mounted on a truck bed, which also includes cleaning, water spray, air supply, positioning, power supply, and electrical control systems. This solution aims to improve traffic efficiency, reduce road operation risks, and help enterprises cut costs and boost efficiency. The conceptual graph illustrates a 6-DoF robotic arm used for cleaning the tunnel lighting system, connected to a van equipped with various supporting systems.

## Research Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent integrated tunnel lighting cleaning operation platform. By applying advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and intelligent control, this platform will achieve automatic cleaning and maintenance of tunnel lighting facilities, improving cleaning efficiency, reducing operating costs, and ensuring driving safety.


## Research Approach
During the development process, my main contributions included CAD modeling design related to the project structure and corresponding motion simulation analysis. By reviewing and analyzing domestic and international literature and technical materials in the field of tunnel cleaning, I proposed the “mechanical extension arm” solution to address the problem of cleaning tunnel lighting. I also used SolidWorks for CAD design and conducted simulation analysis of the model.


## Specific Design Process
The “mechanical extension arm” solution for tunnel lighting cleaning involves the design of three mechanical arms, a rotating connection platform, and a cleaning spray platform. The rotating connection platform is fixed at the rear of a truck bed, which also houses the cleaning system, water spray system, air supply system, positioning system, power supply system, and electrical control system. This solution improves traffic efficiency, reduces risks associated with road operations, and helps enterprises reduce costs and increase efficiency.

## Description of Conceptual graph of Intelligent Tunnel Lighting Cleaning Platform

Based on the research and development of an intelligent integrated tunnel lighting cleaning operation platform, to realize the automatic cleaning and maintenance of tunnel lighting facilities, improve the cleaning efficiency, reduce operating costs, safeguard traffic safety and other needs, the intelligent tunnel lighting cleaning platform schematic diagram shows the main use of 6 degrees of freedom robotic arm program to achieve the cleaning of the tunnel lighting system. It mainly consists of a bottom rotating table connected to the rear of the van, and then three sections of the same length but gradually narrowed mechanical arm, as well as a connecting arm and a cleaning table. The van is equipped with a cleaning system, a water spray system, an air supply system, a positioning system, a power supply system and an electrical control system.
