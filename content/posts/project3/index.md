## Statement of Need

Designing and producing exhibits for the Discovery Space Children's Museum in State College, USA.... When designing the exhibits, the user's experience of the exhibits should be taken into account. The museum's target group is children aged 2 - 12. The exhibits should ideally create an engaging experience. The immediate purpose of these exhibits is to simultaneously engage, entertain, and educate children about physics or science principles. The larger and greater purpose is to help attract more of the best and brightest children to careers in engineering and science.





## Statement of Problem

In contemporary education, fostering holistic development in children encompasses not only cognitive and academic prowess but also the enhancement of physical abilities and practical knowledge. Motor skills play a pivotal role in a child's overall development. Studies have shown that a robust foundation in motor skills during early childhood lays the groundwork for proficient physical capabilities throughout life. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that children with well-developed motor skills tend to perform better academically, exhibit higher levels of confidence, and display improved social interactions.


In today's technological landscape, fostering early education in fundamental concepts like basic electricity is important. However, there exists a significant gap in understanding the role this knowledge plays in the development of children. Lack of exposure to basic electricity not only hinders comprehension of everyday devices but also suppresses their ability to engage within our technology-driven world. This deficiency in understanding poses a major hurdle to the overall development of young minds, slowing down their problem-solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and creativity. Addressing this issue is important for the younger generation to help with essential skills, enhancing their curiosity, and enabling them to become confident, and resourceful individuals in the world we live in today.

##  Concept Design
The document presents a concept called Exciting Pass. It is a Design Project for Discovery Space Museum Exhibit that has the immediate purpose of simultaneously engaging, entertaining, and educating kids about physics or science principles, and to help attract more of the best and brightest kids into engineering and science fields. One value proposition is that Exciting Pass will teach kids some of the most basic circuits and physics and help them develop important skills such as patience when faced with a challenge and thinking positively about problems. In choosing the Exciting Pass concept, our team made assumptions that influenced the final product. Since our Exciting Pass will be used in the Discovery Space Museum Exhibit and the audience will be young children, it was paramount to ensure that the concept would be safe to use, and that children would be at risk of electrocution if they touched the metal routes during the Exciting Pass experience (even if the voltage of the Exciting Pass is below the safe voltage for humans). Therefore, we need to assume that children are using the pass in a safe manner and are not touching the metal parts. In the next subsections, we explain the steps in the design process we took to select a final design concept for Exciting Pass. First, the first subsection will explain the functional structure and system decomposition process. The next subsection will examine the prototype requirements and accompanying metrics and specifications, and the next subsection will describe the methodology used to generate the Exciting Pass concept. Then the next section describes the screening and selection process we used to determine the final concepts. The next section presents pictures of our CAD models along with basic features. The final section presents the 0th prototype and some details about what we did. 


## Function Structure and System Decomposition
During the design process, our team created a functional structure and system decomposition diagram for our Exciting Pass. The goal of developing this diagram was to break down and analyze the major functions and components needed to address our Exciting Pass. Additionally, the functional structure and system decomposition diagram allowed our team to determine the best way to order the selected mechanisms in the final concept. Figure 2 represents the functional breakdown diagram created for Exciting Pass. This functional breakdown diagram primarily describes the operational logic and functionality of Exciting Pass. Children would first pick up the METAL RING, wrap it around the METAL PATH and begin the challenge. If the metal path is not touched during the game, the challenge is considered successful. However, if the metal path is touched, a buzzer will sound and an LED light will illuminate to indicate that the challenger has failed the challenge and needs to return to the starting point to start the game again until they succeed.

## Prototype Needs and Accompanying Metrics and Specifications
For the Exciting Pass project, our team has been guided by four primary objectives outlined by the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Discovery Space. Our exhibit is designed to provide an educational experience for children, incorporating vital considerations such as health and safety, ease of maintenance for staff, child engagement, and alignment with institutional missions and educational goals. The multiple prototype needs are highlighted in our exhibit, ensuring that it not only captures the imagination of children but also fulfills the aspirations of our academic pursuit. In terms of cost, our exhibit is designed to be cost-effective, with a minimum cost of $30 and a maximum cost of $50.


In pursuit of our goal to prioritize the safety of children, we have established sturdy metrics and specifications. A low voltage battery supplied power, operating within the safe voltage range of 9V to 12V, is at the core of our electrical design, offering a secure environment for children to interact with the exhibit. In parallel, all corners of the base table, measuring 0.8m in height, 1m in length, and 0.6m in width, are meticulously rounded off to eliminate sharp edges, thus ensuring a risk-free play environment where children can explore and learn without concern for potential hazards. The total volume of the base table is approximately 0.48 cubic feet.


Ease of maintenance is another foundational aspect of the Exciting Pass. We have diligently formulated metrics and specifications that emphasize the importance of creating an exhibit that stands the test of time. This entails the use of durable materials that guarantee longevity and minimal wear and tear. Furthermore, we place strong emphasis on making components easily accessible, simplifying maintenance tasks for the dedicated staff at Discovery Space. An integrated on/off switch for the circuit adds a layer of safety as well as convenience, enabling the staff to power down the exhibit swiftly during maintenance procedures, contributing to the long-term sustainability of the exhibit.


Engagement of children is another core objective of the Exciting Pass, and our metrics and specifications reflect this commitment. The base table, with its dimensions, is designed with vibrant and attractive colors, capturing the attention of young kids. In addition, we've integrated the letters "PSU," representing Pennsylvania State University, not only as a branding element but also as an educational component that stirs children's curiosity about the university, fostering a sense of wonder and exploration. To elevate the engagement further, a small speaker and LED lights are incorporated, dynamically lighting up with varying patterns based on a player's success, providing instant and gratifying feedback that heightens the overall experience.

## Concept Generation
We employed a structured technique known as the 6-3-5 Method to generate concepts for addressing the challenges outlined in the project. Each of us jotted down three unique ideas related to the specified problem within a designated time frame. After the initial round, the papers were passed to the right, each of us built upon the ideas presented by their peers, contributing three additional concepts. This process continued through three iterations, resulting in more grounded and sound ideas. By harnessing the collective creativity and diverse perspectives of our team members, this method allowed us to explore a wide array of potential solutions. These concepts served as the foundation for our proposal, enabling us to present a range of better approaches. Through the 6-3-5 Method, we fostered an environment of structured creativity, ensuring that our proposal was enriched with inventive solutions, promising to address the project challenges effectively. After going through the process of brainstorming ideas we came and put together 3 designs to choose from.

## Concept Screening and Selection
The next step in the process is to complete a concept screen for each mechanism to narrow down our concept selection. The goal of concept screening is not to accurately measure each idea, but to narrow our focus to more realistic concepts to save time and maximize our effectiveness. Throughout the process we used the AHP matrix as well as the AHP selection matrix to determine the concepts selected by our group. As shown in Table 3, our group identified attractiveness, flexibility, aesthetics, and ease of assembly as the four factors we were concerned with. We then compared the importance of these four factors to each other using the AHP matrix and gave them each a score. For example, in the third row and second column of Table 3, the score is 5, which means that flexibility is five times more important than attractiveness. By scoring each other's importance we can calculate the total score for each row, and then divide the total score for each row by the sum to get the AHP weight for each factor, as shown in column 7 of table 3. From the AHP matrix, we know that simplicity of assembly is the most important for our group, followed by flexibility, then aesthetics, and finally attractiveness. Next we will use the AHP selection matrix as shown in table 4, we will first score each concept (1-5) according to how well they fulfill these four factors. Then the AHP matrix weight is multiplied by the score of each concept to get the weighted scores of each concept and then each weighted score is compared and we can get the ranking of each concept. As table 4 shows, Concept 2 has the highest score, so our group will ultimately choose Concept 2 as our final choice.

## CAD Drawing of Selected Design Concept
This section mainly states the CAD model of our group, as shown in figure 4, our CAD model mainly consists of a base with a metal path and a metal ring, and of course the CAD model also shows the exact location of the Buzzer and the LED strip. In our concept we also used 3D printed parts, as shown in figure 3, this is a hand guard, the main purpose is for safety and to prevent kids from getting electrocuted during use. The children need to hold the hand guard to play, and in our CAD model we have also clearly marked the position of our 3D printed parts, as shown in figure 4.

## 0th prototype of the general design concept
This section presents the 0th prototype of our general design concept, as shown in figure 5. For our 0th prototype, we used cardboard to make the base of the Exciting Pass and the iron wire as the metal path and wires. In addition, we connected each part together by tape to make them much stronger. Although it is pretty simple, it is a good model for Exciting Pass and it shows the principles of our concept clearly. 


{{< figure src="e9.png" title="Figure 5. 0th prototype of Exciting Pass" >}}


## Alpha 1 prototype
For our Alpha 1 prototype, it is almost done by 40% of the final. We made a wood base box instead of the previous cardboard base of 0th prototype. In addition, we almost finished the metal track shape. We just twisted three single metal wires into a big one, and then made them look like a PSU. We also drilled the holes for the metal track and buzzer on the top of the base box. However, our circuit didn’t finish at that time, and there was also one surface left to assemble which was just for us to make the circuit easily. Actually, due to the wood material we used, the durability of that has been increased more. However, we didn’t add the support for the metal track, so the durability of the metal track is still weak. For safety, I think it was a great score at that time, because we polished the corner of the base box and made the metal track curved if there is a 90 degrees turn. For STEM, it was much better than the previous one. It is almost done for the base box and the shape of metal track which means it can show better concepts, principles and knowledge about physics and circuits. However, it still can’t work completely, due to incompleteness of the whole thing, so the STEM of that was not as good as we’d like it to be.

## Alpha 2 prototype
For our Alpha 2 prototype, it is almost done by 80% of the final. We connected the last side surface to the main by two hinges which means it is like a door and is convenient for staff to maintain or inbox circuit. We also finished the circuit and the holder made by 3d printing to make it work. We also added two 3d printing track fixers at the beginning and the end of the metal track to make it stable. Therefore, for safety, it has great performance, because we hid the circuit inside and made a plastic holder to avoid kids from getting a shock. We will add some notices to remind kids not to touch the metal parts in the later(final). For durability, it became much better than before, because we added two fixers to keep the shape and fixed every part by using glue. For STEM, it definitely has better performance than before, because the main function of our project works right now, which means it becomes attractive, and it can almost show total principles, concepts, and knowledge of circuit and physics.

## Final Product
Based on the Alpha 2 prototype, we made further improvements to the final product:
- Decoration: We added decoration to make it more attractive in appearance.
- Wooden base: the wooden base was glazed and polished to improve its durability and aesthetics.
- Track Fixers: Two 3D printed track fixers were further fixed to enhance the stability of the track.
- Side Door: A lock was added to the side door location to improve safety and convenience.
- Platform design: A platform for placing the HOLDER was designed and added to provide better display and usage functions.
