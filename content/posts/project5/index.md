The project focuses on developing an intelligent transporter for semi-assembled concrete guardrails, combining automation, precision mechanical design, IoT, and AI to streamline the grasping, transportation, and installation processes. The transporter features six degrees of freedom, including main frame lifting, horizontal rotation, and forward/backward swing, allowing it to adapt to various site conditions. It boasts a maximum lifting capacity of over 10 tons and a lifting height exceeding 4500 mm. Recent improvements enhance structural integrity and flexibility, such as repositioning the cockpit for better balance and adding support arms for increased strength. The project is currently in the testing phase, aiming to create a robust and efficient solution for intelligent guardrail installation.

## Research Objective
To develop a device that integrates automation control, precision mechanical design, IoT technology and artificial intelligence algorithms to accurately and quickly locate the guardrail under the guidance of construction vehicles, and automatically complete the grasping, transportation and installation, realizing the intelligent and automated installation of semi-assembled hollow-core concrete guardrail.
## Current Research Plan
In order to achieve the research objectives and solve the problem of intelligent assembly of hollow concrete guardrail, we decided to design an intelligent straddle transport vehicle to meet the objective requirements and solve the problem. The project is currently in the testing stage
## My contribution
### Literature research:
Check the domestic and international literature and technical information about the straddle carrier and related fields.
### CAD Modeling and Simulation:
CAD modeling preliminary design of the project structure using SolidWorks and motion simulation analysis.
#### Preliminary Design Program:
After reviewing and analyzing domestic and international literature and technical data on tunnel cleaning and and other related fields, I used SolidWorks to CAD design it.
The equipment consists of six parts: chassis, lifting system, positioning attachment, protection system, hydraulic system, and electric control system.

The equipment has six degrees of freedom:

① Main frame lifting  
② Forward and backward movement  
③ Lifting  
④ Left and right movement  
⑤ Horizontal rotation  
⑥ Forward and backward swing 

These features allow for flexible action according to the actual site conditions.

Main Technical Parameters:

|-------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| Maximum Dimensions (L×W×H)    | mm    | 7000×7000×9000 |
| Maximum Lifting Weight        | T     | ≥10            |
| Maximum Lifting Height        | mm    | ≥4500          |
| Maximum Forward/Backward Stroke | mm    | ≥2000          |
| Maximum Left/Right Stroke     | mm    | ≥1500          |
| Running Speed (Unloaded)      | m/min | 1-10           |
| Running Speed (Loaded)        | m/min | 0.5-5          |


1、Chassis

The chassis is driven by hydraulic motor to move and steer the equipment, the rated weight of the whole machine is ≥10T, and it is powered by internal combustion engine. The steering system is arranged on each tire mechanism, and the steering system consists of slewing bearing and cylinder drive, control system, etc., which can meet the requirements of equipment straight, traverse, 0 ~ 90 ° steering and other operational requirements. The wheels are made of solid tires (or polyurethane), which reduces the damage to the ground during steering of the crane and at the same time has high friction with the ground.

2、Lifting system
Lifting system consists of the main frame lifting, lifting mobile trolley, lifting adjustment device and other components.

(1) Main frame lifting
The main frame lifting is an important part of the realization of the guardrail lifting.
This part is mainly through the hydraulic cylinder expansion and contraction to drive the main frame for lifting, with the lifting of the main arm, can realize the guardrail lifting and placing work, guardrail lifting height ≥ 4500mm, the main frame lifting height ≥ 1800mm.

(2) Lifting trolley

The lifting and moving trolley can realize forward and backward movement and left and right movement, through the movement of the trolley, synchronous control with the lifting appliance, it can be moved flexibly in the working scene, so as to realize the flexible movement of the guardrail and rotational adjustment.

The movement parameters of the mechanism are as follows:

1. Forward and backward moving stroke: ≥1500mm;
2. Left-right moving stroke: ≥1500mm;

(3) Lifting adjustment device

The lifting and adjusting device can realize the lifting and attitude adjustment of the appliance. The lifting cylinder drives the main arm to realize the lifting and lowering of the clamping guardrail, adjusts the central axis rotating platform to realize the rotating operation of the appliance, and adjusts the swinging cylinder to realize the forward and backward swinging of the appliance.

The parameters of the system are as follows:

1. Lifting height of main arm: 2500mm;
2. Center axis rotating angle: 360°;
Precision of center axis rotation: ≤0.4°;
3. Front and rear deflection angle: ±8°;

3、Specialized quick attachment

The handling attachment can be quickly installed and replaced, the serialized design can ensure that 1~5 guardrails can be handled at a time, while the central axis rotating platform and swing cylinder can be adjusted for guardrail attitude, the middle of the attachment is equipped with guardrail guiding elements, which can realize the rapid and non-destructive positioning of the guardrail, and is convenient to carry out the next step of the lifting work, and the guardrail can be automatically picked up by the hydraulic hooks, and at the same time, through the bias adjusting springs, the self-adaptation of multiple guardrails can be realized. At the same time, the offset adjusting spring can realize the self-adaptive position adjustment of multiple guardrails to prevent collision between guardrails.

#### Current improvement program：

Based on the initial proposal, I have adjusted the structure of the straddle carrier as well as the cockpit location to be more mechanically sound and aesthetically pleasing to the design.
1. I designed the cockpit from its original position under the left side to avoid overhanging the cockpit and to make it more mechanically rational, and used 40 reinforced screws (20 front and 20 rear) to connect it to the left side.
2. I designed interfaces to connect the cockpit on both the left and the right side, so that the cockpit can be mounted on the left or the right side, in order to adapt to different complexities and to increase flexibility.
3. I added triangular support arms on both the left and right sides to improve the structural strength of the transporter and to ensure that it is mechanically sound.
