The project, “E-bin: The Future of Goodwill Giving,” aimed to improve the efficiency of Goodwill's donation collection and reduce operational costs by designing an innovative donation system that leverages advanced technologies, such as a weight measurement system and a mobile application, to optimize the use of donation bins.

During the design process, we began by identifying inefficiencies, aesthetics, and high operational costs associated with existing donation bins, and identified key stakeholders, including donors, transporters, Goodwill employees, and consumers. After several design iterations, we ultimately chose smart garbage cans as the final solution. In the first iteration, we generated multiple concepts and ultimately selected the Smart Bin. In the second iteration, we further refined the design with a focus on technology integration and meeting stakeholder needs, and conducted prototype testing to validate the physical design, application functionality, cost savings, and feasibility of the sensor system.

The final design utilizes a metal structure and imitates the appearance of wood, complete with a weight measurement system and mobility features. It also includes a garden component that utilizes a rainwater harvesting system to support plant growth and uses recycled materials, enhancing the product's sustainability and durability.The E-bin can be seamlessly integrated into Goodwill's existing donation process, as its aesthetically pleasing design lends itself to placement in the community. The E-bin is expected to cost less than $1,000 per E-bin and save Goodwill up to $250 per month in operating expenses by reducing the number of pickups of donation boxes. By increasing the quality and quantity of donations, the E-bin not only contributes to Goodwill's financial health, but also promotes community sustainability.

Future recommendations include building a full-size model of the E-bin and testing all of its components in a real-world environment to ensure the design is comprehensive and practical. Through these innovative designs and improvements, the E-bin project is expected to bring significant economic and social benefits to Goodwill, driving modernization and efficiency in the donation process.

## Problem Understanding
### Background Research 
Our initial research focused on Goodwill’s current clothing donation dumpsters. We looked into components and problems associated with them. These problems overlap with issues created by all types of dumpsters, not just Goodwill dumpsters (there is a lot more available information about regular dumpsters). Issues we discovered include dumpsters being unattractive and unsanitary, dumpsters that are too heavy and big to move, Goodwill dumpsters precisely not being placed in the most efficient/beneficial locations, and Goodwill wasting money on too frequent pickups.

After narrowing down problems, we brainstormed to think of solutions and then did research on the logistics of those ideas. We determined that a weight scale used in the dumpster would be low cost and solve several problems, including measuring when the dumpster is full and allowing Goodwill workers to gauge the best times for pickups. For the dumpster to communicate with workers, an app could be developed. This app would store data from various bins and allow Goodwill to see which locations are getting the most donations (they could then adjust the placement of the bins). Wheels added to the dumpster would make it mobile and deter rodents from burrowing under.
### Current Process Visualization
Goodwill operates using donated goods and resells them at low prices to consumers. Goodwill is a nonprofit, which means its focus is serving the public good and they do not make money, instead, money is reinvested into its mission. Significant challenges Goodwill's faces include labor, reliance on donations, and lack of automation. 

{{< figure src="p6.1.png" title="Current Process Visualization" >}}

### Problem and Stakeholder Definition
Donors to Goodwill are a stakeholder; they have to find a way to get their donations to the company. Donors also may receive tax benefits from donating. Transportation systems and those who work in transportation (ex: truck drivers) have to find a way to move donated items and be compensated for that. Furthermore, Goodwill employees have a stake. Store workers, CEOs, and maintenance workers are all subject to Goodwill’s working conditions and pay. Consumers, especially low-income ones, are reliant on Goodwill to provide affordable high-quality products. Lastly, Trash systems are a stakeholder because Goodwill must find a way to dispose of unwanted donations. Things like landfills, clearance centers, and the environment are all dependent on Goodwill’s system of getting rid of the trash.

Our needs identification process consisted of thinking about everyone/every entity involved in the process, from something being donated to it being sold or thrown away. Going through every step we found that basically, everyone involved had some stake in Goodwill in one way or another.

With this information, we brainstormed ideas to make the stakeholders’ lives easier and come up with how might we statements. We thought of solutions that are both technologically based and ones that revolve more around the structuring of the company. We focused on solving our HMW statements but didn’t limit our ideas to the original problems we thought of.

## First Design Iteration
### Concept Generation and Screening
To develop concepts, we worked individually and targeted different issues to create ideas that solve our how might we statements. Using the research about Goodwill’s current process, we brainstormed ways to improve that through automation/innovation. After individually working, we came together as a group and talked about which ideas had potential, and which were not feasible. 

Ideas we moved forward with:
##### Idea 1
{{< figure src="p6.2.png" >}}

Goodwill Mascot Robot: This robot would ride around or stand at events to collect money. It would feature audio broadcasted remotely from a voice actor. It would have to be controlled by a remote or using GPS, and would help Goodwill raise more funds to achieve their mission and donate to charity
##### Idea 2
{{< figure src="p6.3.png" >}}

This modified Goodwill dumpster would include technology to tell Goodwill when it's full, it would have a semi-automate wheel system to make transportation easier, and algorithms would be used to determine the best neighborhoods to place them. It would help Goodwill receive more/better donations.
##### Idea 3
{{< figure src="p6.4.png" >}}

This folding machine would reduce manual labor for Goodwill and speed up their process of organizing clothes
##### Idea 4
{{< figure src="p6.5.png" >}}

Advertising on commonly seen items, like packaging tape, would make Goodwill more well-known and therefore bring in more donations/volunteers.

Using this information, we looked at our ideas, what they accomplish, and what they leave to be desired. We decided as a group which idea has the most potential to be modified so it meets most of Goodwill’s and the stakeholders’ needs (modified Goodwill dumpster). We then brainstormed individually about the Goodwill dumpster and came together as a group to discuss components and test them.


### Alpha Prototyping and Research
We each did research and worked on prototypes individually for the ideas that made it through our initial screening process. The research consisted of looking into possibilities/logistics online as well as discussing options as a group.
#### Concept 1
Printing the donation information on packaging tape: this idea will use the popularity of express delivery to make more people know information about Goodwill and the donation process.

While developing this idea, a more eye-catching design should have been used with clear information about the Goodwill donation process. This would allow people to know how/where to donate unwanted clothes. These boxes could also be placed at the checkout counter of a large supermarket (Walmart/Target) and given to people when they need them for promotional purposes.

Data analysis methods were used to compare package advertising to other forms such as tv commercials or radio ads. It was determined that packaging ads are more efficient due to the relatively low cost to reach the same amount of people.

With a small investment, more people can know the advertising content through express box advertising with a higher transmission rate, which is more cost-effective and efficient than traditional TV/radio advertising.
{{< figure src="p6.6.png" >}}

#### Concept 2
A folding machine attached to a conveyer belt, for clothes to be efficiently folded and transported onto a display case and/or rack.

Some were concerned with the safety of the folding machine so some form of a safety mechanism was recommended. An ON and OFF switch should be added somewhere at the front of the mechanism, for easy access. A way to get funding to build this machine must be considered and a place to put the folding machine in each goodwill store must also be considered.

Through research and peer discussion, we’ve found that it will be very difficult for goodwill to find a source, to get enough funding to build the folding machine. Furthermore, the folding machine will be put in a back room of every goodwill, with the conveyor belt leading to the shelves.

{{< figure src="p6.7.png" >}}
#### Concept 3
A robotic Goodwill mascot meant to collect donations/fundraise. The robot would be made of metal and have Goodwill’s logo as its face. It would travel using a modified hoverboard that is reassembled to a metal frame. It would be controlled remotely by a person following the robot, who would also transmit Bluetooth audio for the robot to talk. The robot would include an arm that knocks on doors and it would have a slot to insert money similar to a vending machine.

Some were concerned that the robot would be annoying and people wouldn’t want it knocking on their doors and asking for money. The robot could also be a target for theft if it has money inside of it. Durability is an issue; how will it stand up to weather/wear and tear? A big issue brought up was how the robot would climb upstairs/porches.

It was found through peer discussion that a robot that acts as a solicitor of sorts may not be feasible. Its transportation using wheels will not work on all terrain. If we move forward with this idea, another mode of movement may have to be used, perhaps a drone-type system, although that presents its own issues like weight.
{{< figure src="p6.8.png" >}}

#### Concept 4
A goodwill dumpster that has the technology to increase its efficiency in its area by measuring how quickly it fills up in the area it's moved to. This would require a sensor to measure when it is full. A Bluetooth system to notify the store when it is full and to keep track. Also, it would need a transportation system to move the dumpster and pick up donations.

The sensor would need to be either a weight-based scale or protected against the weather. There would need to be a system to prevent people from throwing trash into it and or non-clothing donations. It would need an anti-theft system to prevent those from stealing donations and from stealing the dumpster itself.

There are sensors made for waste bins making it possible to use a non-weight scale sensor making it more accurate when notifying that it is full. The anti-theft system would require the dumpster to be able to attach to something that way it is still mobile and safe from theft.
{{< figure src="p6.9.png" >}}
### Concept Selection
We decided to move forward with our updated donation collecting system. We came to this decision after making an excel concept matrix and finding that this idea had the highest overall ranking based on our criteria. The criteria which we used to make our decisions are safety, durability, effectiveness, and cost. We refined our idea by evaluating the faults, making real-world assumptions, and giving each other feedback on our updated solutions.
## Design Requirements
Our final idea for the dumpster will be composed of metal, but the metal will be formed to look more like wood siding. It will have a weight scale that tracks when the dumpster is full, and technology to alert someone using an app. The dumpster will have a system to connect to a truck/van so it can be transported easily.	

We used the aspects of our final design to break up the dumpster and assign different components to each team member. We broke it into 4 main groups: physical design, transportation system, app development, and technology within the dumpster (ex: sensors). We each plan to design these parts and bring them together, adjusting elements of them as need be.

| Customer Need   | Our Design                                                                                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cost Effective  | Low cost (dumpsters tend to cost around \$600 without technological components), able to be mass-produced. |
| Durable         | Made of sheet metal, very durable and able to withstand the weather. Gutters make it durable against rain. |
| Efficient       | Will allow Goodwill to collect more high-quality donations, and pickups less often.            |
| Safe            | Lockable wheels will allow workers to move it easily while staying in place when needed. Its weight will keep it stable in strong weather. |

We kept this research in mind while moving along in the design process. Components of our dumpster would eventually need to be changed, but we made sure to preserve the cost, durability, efficiency, and safety of our dumpster

## Second Design Iteration
### Concept Generation and Selection
#### Concept Generation
We decided to move forward with our “updated” donation collecting system. We came to this decision after making an excel concept matrix and finding that this idea had the highest overall ranking based on our criteria.

We broke it into 4 main groups: physical design, transportation system, app development, and technology within the dumpster (ex: sensors). We each plan to design these parts and bring them together, adjusting elements of them as need be. 
### Beta Prototyping and Feasibility Testing

#### Beta Prototype 1

This prototype is intended to test the physical design of our dumpster. This includes how it functions aesthetically in neighborhoods, its structure, and the layout of the dumpster’s components (doors, roof, garden, etc.). We wanted to create a design for the dumpster that doesn’t necessarily look like Goodwill’s current dumpsters but functions better than their current design. 

{{< figure src="p6.10.png" >}}

Through discussion, our team determined that the physical dumpster needs some elements to be added. Doors should be added on the donation slots to protect the donation. A locking mechanism should also be incorporated into the roof. Wheels must be added for easy transport; lastly, gutters/drainage should be included to prevent water damage. 

{{< figure src="p6.11.png" >}}

#### Beta Prototype 2

Prototype 2 tested how the goodwill employee app, linked to the e-Bin, is going to work for the truck drivers. More specifically, a prototype app to demonstrate the most efficient way to present when an e-Bin dumpster is full and where it is located, to be emptied and transported to goodwill efficiently.
    
The most effective way of building this prototype app was through a website called Mobincuber. There is a login page as soon as the app is opened, which only the goodwill employees will have access to, from a specified login. After login, the app will go to a menu page where the “dumpster location pick-up” will be shown. When this is pressed the individual will be located to a page showing all the goodwill dumpsters in their town, which are ready and not ready to be picked up. If an e-bin is presented as “READY” the employee can press on it, this will take them to a separate page showing the location of that e-bin for the truck driver to pick up from. When a truck driver pursues a certain dumpster, they must select the option to keep that bin on hold to prevent any other truck driver from attending the same e-Bin at capacity.

#### Beta Prototype 3

This prototype tested the cost savings of having Goodwill drivers pickup e-bins when they are full versus Goodwill’s current truck driving expenses. First, it was calculated that each truck could carry 16 donation boxes. It will take about 3 days to fill each donation box. They will be shipped once every 3 days, so we can calculate the cost (including time cost and transportation cost) of transporting a truck once, which is $369.12. However, if we reduce pickups using the e-bin, the cost will be greatly reduced. By comparing the price of similar pickup services (ex: Uber), the cost per mile is $1.93, and the distance from each donation box to the warehouse center is about 5 miles. If each private car can only transport one donation box (in fact, each private car can transport more), the actual cost is only $154.4.

Driver salary:


|         | Dollars per Hour | Dollars per Mile |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Uber    | 11.77            | 1.93             |
| Grubhub | 12               | 0.22             |
| Walmart | 17.48            | 0.89             |
| Target  | 22.31            | 0.6              |
| Goodwill| 15.38            | 0.516            |


This is an analogous calculation according to the uber with the highest unit price.

|                                | Value  |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| Hourly wage for truck drivers (dollar) | 15.38  |
| Working time (per 3 days)      | 24     |
| Daily wage (dollar)            | 369.12 |
| Uber fee per mile              | 1.93   |
| Distance between dumpster and center | 5    |
| Pay for one single driver      | 9.65   |
| The number of drivers          | 16     |
| Pay totally                    | 154.4  |


The calculation shows that if we calculate according to the highest price in the market, the order-taking mode can still greatly save costs, which indicates that if we calculate according to other lower prices, the order taking mode (picking up only when necessary) will only save more money for Goodwill. 

#### Beta Prototype 4

Prototype 4 intended to test what sensor system would be better suited for the E-bin. The best options for the E-bin were a pressure scale and or a sensor at the top of the E-bin. The pressure scale was chosen to be tested due to its higher durability/reliability.

{{< figure src="p6.14.jpg" >}}
The pressure scale system may be more durable but it likely wouldn’t be accurate about how full the E-bin is due to different densities in clothing along with the fact that rain will cause the clothes to be heavier. A sensor at the top of the E-bin won’t be as durable but will be much more accurate, and if it had to be replaced due to damage of any nature it would be much easier than a pressure scale at the bottom of the bin.

### Conclusions of Second Design Iteration
Our team conducted a beta prototype study for about a week, and each team member analyzed his or her own results and discussed them. The beta prototype of each team member would be of much help to the subsequent study. The physical dumpster needs some elements to be added. Doors should be added to the donation slots to protect the donation. A locking mechanism should also be incorporated into the roof. Wheels must be added for easy transport; lastly, gutters/drainage should be included to prevent water damage. The Beta prototype also perfected the entire process of drivers receiving orders via the app. And how the sensor at the bottom of The Dumpster communicates with the app. The new app delivery model makes the transportation process more efficient and economical.

## Final Design and Evaluation

### Final Design Description
Our prototype will be made of wood, connected with screws and wood glue. It will be about 1ft long, 8in deep, and 8in tall. The prototype will be similar in structure to our beta prototype version of the dumpster (this prototype modeled the physical design). The roof of the dumpster will be connected to the wood structure with hinges. We will also include a locking mechanism. The front of the dumpster will have doors allowing donors to open them and insert clothes. We will add gutters to the roof of the dumpster, and the garden area will have drainage holes. Inside the dumpster, the floor will be a platform held up by a spring, which will allow the weight of the clothes to be measured to determine when it’s full. Wheels will be attached to the bottom to allow it to be rolled up onto a trailer and transported. We chose to make this prototype because it demonstrates the most possible features of our e-bin, all the while being feasible to build and test. The visuals of a 3d concept come to life will give investors an idea of what the product looks like as opposed to a prototype based on technology/research.

{{< figure src="p6.14.png" >}}

### Sustainability
Our e-bin tackles sustainability in numerous ways, including specific components we added and the innate structure of the design. Being made of sheet metal, the e-bin can be assembled using recycled materials; likewise, after its lifespan, it can be repurposed/recycled. The sheet metal structure will make the e-bin durable and give it a long lifespan, making it better for the environment than a product that needs to be reproduced often. The garden component of the e-bin will allow plant life to flourish and improve the ecosystem in the e-bin’s immediate area. This garden will be efficient, water will be supplied from gutters that collect rainwater from the e-Bin's roof.

### Market Feasibility Analysis
Due to donation dumpsters already being a part of Goodwill’s process, we are confident that our modified e-bins will fit into this system without causing disruption. The relatively low cost and opportunities for Goodwill to save money make the e-bin a strong investment. Lastly, the e-bin’s aesthetically pleasing design will allow it to be placed in neighborhoods without upsetting residents.
With technological components, the e-bin should cost $1,000 or less to produce. Recurring costs are the same costs already associated with current Goodwill dumpsters, so they will not affect Goodwill's bottom line. In fact, the e-bin will save Godwill up to $250 a month in pickups (including gas and labor) and will earn Goodwill money in the long run through more high-quality donations (This amount is difficult to predict, but it could be thousands). 

### Evaluation of Stakeholder Needs

| Design Requirement  | Specification                                         | Evaluation Method                                                                 | Results/expected result                                                                                      |

| **Durable**         | - Can handle rainstorms, human interaction, falling debris | - Placing outside for a long period of time                                       | - Unable to be accurately tested due to our final prototype not being made of actual materials (metal)        |
| **Efficient/effective** | - Does it achieve the goal in a feasible way?            | - Will strategically placed dumpsters offer Goodwill better donations allowing them to make more money?<br>- Will the weight scale and app reduce pickups? | - Expected: Yes, fewer pickups and better donations. (determined through research)                            |
| **Safe**            | - Stable in windy conditions. Doesn’t roll.           | - Wheels that lock; heavy enough to be stable                                     | - We failed to add wheels with a locking mechanism                                                            |


## Conclusions and Recommendations

Our e-bin was created with the intentions of saving Goodwill money through less frequent pickups and giving them more opportunities to earn profit by receiving more donations. The fundamentals of our concept proved to be both feasible and functional; components such as the app, weight scale, structural design, and transportation system will save Goodwill money in the long run and make their process more efficient. These features were all alpha prototyped and tested, eventually being revised so that they meet Goodwill’s needs. The features we didn’t alpha prototype turned out to be problematic for the e-bin. Components such as locking wheels and doors, and the durability of the sheet metal structure have yet to be tested and changed accordingly. Moving forward, a model of the e-bin should be assembled and composed entirely of sheet metal. This model should include all proposed components (locking mechanisms, scale, drainage) so that the design can be accurately tested in an outdoor environment.
