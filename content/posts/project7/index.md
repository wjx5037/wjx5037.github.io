I am participating in the ACRP challenge with my team, focusing on enhancing the passenger experience at airports, particularly by using technological innovations to reduce baggage handling issues. Research shows that most baggage problems arise from transfer delays, and current airport infrastructure and technology can't keep up with the growing travel demand. We are concentrating on optimizing baggage sorting, using RFID for tracking, redesigning airport layouts to improve efficiency, and reducing human error through automation. After brainstorming and using a decision matrix, we found that the "end-to-end visibility tracking and updates" solution has the most potential, so we've decided to prioritize its implementation. Next, we'll develop prototypes ranging from sketches to detailed models, considering practical factors like time and budget, and collaborate with industry experts to ensure the design's practicality. Through testing and feedback, we aim to refine the design, build stakeholder confidence, and demonstrate a viable solution that can be further developed.

## Project Background

In modern air travel, enhancing passenger experience is a key goal for airport operations. Our team is involved in the ACRP project, focusing on improving terminal design through innovative technology, particularly in baggage handling systems, to reduce mishandling and delays.

## ACRP Challenge Topic
Our team is continuing work on ACRP Challenge II-C, Passenger Experience and Innovations in Airport Terminal Design, specifically “Passenger experience technologies such as restroom cleanliness monitoring, passenger wayfinding, smart building systems, etc.”

## POV Statement
From our research and interviews with industry experts in airport operations, most mishandled baggage comes from delays in getting loaded or transferred between flights, and current airports lack the infrastructure and technology to meet increasing travel demands. While some investment has been made into temporary solutions, there is not yet a comprehensive and complete plan to drastically reduce mishandled baggage rates. It would be beneficial for passengers, airlines, and airports to find a method to reduce the amount of delayed baggage during transfer in order to increase customer satisfaction.

## Key Themes & Insights
Our top three themes and insights that we created to guide our ideation and brainstorming phase were:

### Baggage Sorting at baggage dropoff

RFID and sorting on the conveyor belt after check in

RFID tracking so customers can always know where their bag is

Create a separate baggage drop off for transfer flights so those bags can be prioritized

### Airport/Airplane layout for cargo efficiency

Redesigning the airplane cargo space 

Adding more carry-on space as opposed to checked luggage

Redesign airport layout for more efficiency with baggage transporting

### Improving human interface

Automate more of the work like unloading planes

Robots to automate ground work and decrease human error

## Ideation Activities & Top Ideas
After creating a few key themes and insights we decided to focus on three main areas for our brainstorming activities. These ideas included, RFID tags, organization when offloading bags, and lastly automation of bad loading and unloading reducing risks of human errors. These were mainly based off of our themes we created and the research done from the last phase. Now that we had our three main ideas to focus on we created a white board for brainstorming(see on next page). On this whiteboard we took the week to write any and every idea that came to mind based off of our main ideas. We tried to create branches out of our ideas as well, so if there was an idea that was thought of from another we could show the origin of the thought.

After brainstorming our own ideas on solutions, we met up again to review all of the suggestions, raise concerns, offer feedback, and through elimination eventually select 3 solution contenders. For RFID-based ideas, we looked into the possibility of pairing them with drones to transport luggage of a specific weight range around the airport. Some concerns raised were that a large number of checked bags would be at the drone’s weight limit or heavier and that the drones would need special approval to operate within the vicinity of the airport, as laws currently forbid drones from flying around flight paths/the air space over airports. Additionally, the drones would need a sensor to detect planes and other vehicles moving around them to ensure they don’t hit anything. Overall, while the idea would have been efficient, it was not very practical. Another idea for RFID tags was an automated check-in system. It places RFID tags on bags as passengers check them in. Bags can then be tracked by their RFID tag through the baggage sorting and onboarding systems, allowing the airport to see where bottlenecking is occurring and the passengers can also be provided with timely updates on where their checked bags are. This would alleviate passengers’ concerns with mishandled bags, as even if a bag got lost they (and the airline) would know where, and could also help to pinpoint problematic areas in the baggage checking process. While it would not have a direct impact on efficiency, it would highlight the areas which could be improved and made more efficient. This seemed like a solution closer to our technical capabilities and level of knowledge, which is why we selected it as one of our three final considerations. We also expanded upon this idea for another potential solution, which was to offer end-to-end baggage tracking

Another topic we researched was methods of organizing bags before loading, during loading, and during unloading. We wanted to determine whether we could improve the current methods to allow connecting bags to be loaded last/unloaded first, loaded into a separate compartment, or unloaded and transported to the connection flight in an efficient and cost-effective manner. One such solution was the idea of using terminal specific luggage carts for the transport of bags to connecting flights. This would cut the time it takes for bags to be delivered by the number of different terminals/concourses the airport had, and could also be automated to an extent using driverless vehicles. When brainstorming this idea, we used the example of Atlanta’s international airport, Hartsfield-Jackson, since it has 7 concourses connected only by an underground tunnel. The driverless carts could use part of that underground tunnel to traverse the airport to get to their respective concourses. This would also cut down on the time each cart would take to get to their concourses from the gate the bags arrived into. It was also cost-effective as you would not need to hire additional drivers for the carts. This led to us choosing it as another one of our final contenders for our project solution. We also looked at separating the bags within the cargo hold using RFID tags based on whether they were a one-stop or connecting bag, to allow connecting bags to be unloaded first, and thus have a better chance of making a tight layover, as most mishandled baggage is due to the bag not making it to the connecting flight. We also considered the possibility of flying bags direct to their destination rather than via connections, but realized during our team discussions that it isn’t an option for smaller regional airports who don’t operate international flights, thus not entirely eliminating the chance of a bag being mishandled during connections in that case.

Our last topic area was the automation of baggage loading and unloading during staff shortage events. A situation many experienced during the pandemic and airport worker strikes was that delays in baggage offloading could also cause baggage mishandling, which is why we decided to research the possibility of automating that process. The one issue we ran into was designing solutions that didn’t drastically increase the weight of the plane or require a complete redesign of the cargo hold. We had thought about loading bags onto the plane using rails or a robotic arm, but both would require adding rails, and thus additional weight, in the cargo hold which is not desirable as it would then require more fuel during travel and potentially not be able to carry as many bags to counter the weight increase. 	

Overall, we selected end to end baggage tracking, autonomous vehicles to transport prioritized bags, and lastly automated check in stations as our 3 final contenders for a project solution.

## Concept Selection Decision Matrix
After reviewing all of the information, we performed a detailed analysis of the feasibility and success of each solution using a decision matrix. The matrix showed that the “End-to-End Visibility Tracking and Updates” solution was the highest with an overall rating of 7.625. Although the “Luggage Carts” and “Automated Check in stations” solutions performed well in the complexity and efficiency assessments, their overall scores were still lower than the “End-to-End Visibility Tracking and Updates” solution program. Based on this analysis, we recommend prioritizing the “End-to-End Visibility Tracking and Updates” option to ensure successful implementation.

## Next Steps
The team's next step is to start creating a range of prototypes that will allow for testing and evaluation. These prototypes will vary from simple sketches and 3D models to more detailed physical models if required. This approach will let us try out different tests, designs, and configurations to see what works best for our project. By testing different ideas, we’ll be able to figure out which type of prototype is most effective for demonstrating our solution to stakeholders and making progress toward our goals.	

While we want to stay creative, we also need to consider practical factors like time, budget, and available resources. As we develop different prototypes, we will focus on how each one meets the specific needs of our stakeholders. This means thinking not just about the design but also how easy it is to use and whether it could be produced on a larger scale if needed. 

To decide on our final prototype design the team will collaborate in a brainstorming session, similarly to how we did the idea generation. This will involve coming up with multiple types of prototype designs and discussing amongst ourselves and with industry experts. By involving industry experts in our decision we ensure the design we chose will be relevant and practical in industry. 

Once we’ve decided on a prototype, testing it will be the next key step. We will test the prototype to ensure that it does improve airport luggage systems and will work for our shareholders. Depending on the type of prototype, we might run simulations or create a potential tag design. Testing is crucial as it will help us identify any potential issues and refine the design. The feedback from these tests will guide us in making adjustments to improve the prototypes until we get the best possible version. 

By going through this process of prototyping and testing, we will end up with the best possible prototype for our final design that works best with our stakeholders. With feedback from experts, we will be able to improve the design even more. This will help build stakeholder confidence and show that our design is practical and ready for further development.
