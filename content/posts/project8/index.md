As part of my Capstone Design Project sponsored by Fox Rotating Equipment Solutions, our team developed a novel adjustable diffuser wall to enhance centrifugal compressor testing efficiency. The diffuser plays a critical role in converting kinetic energy to static pressure, yet conventional designs require costly and time-consuming manufacturing of new shroud walls for each test.

To address this challenge, we designed a movable diffuser wall insert capable of adjusting its angle between 0° and 3°. My primary responsibility was CAD design and motion simulation in SolidWorks, ensuring structural feasibility and actuation accuracy. I proposed and implemented an internal drive ring mechanism to push the diffuser wall and achieve precise angle variation while maintaining compatibility with existing instrumentation.

This project not only reduced lead time and cost for diffuser testing but also provided a flexible platform for aerodynamic experimentation. It strengthened my expertise in CAD modeling, mechanical simulation, and design for manufacturability, while demonstrating how engineering innovation can directly support industrial research and development.

## Program Objectives
The goal of this project was to design and develop an adjustable diffuser wall for centrifugal compressor testing that could vary its angle between 0° and 3°. By replacing fixed shroud walls with a movable geometry insert, the project aimed to reduce manufacturing lead time and costs, increase testing flexibility, and enable more efficient aerodynamic experimentation for turbomachinery applications.

## Specific Design Process
Our design process began with identifying the key requirements for a movable diffuser wall, including adjustable geometry (0°–3°), structural stability, and compatibility with instrumentation. We brainstormed multiple actuation methods and selected an internal drive ring mechanism as the most effective solution. Using SolidWorks, I led the CAD modeling and motion simulations to validate the mechanism’s performance, ensuring smooth angle adjustment and durability under operating conditions. The team then refined the geometry for manufacturability and prepared a prototype concept capable of supporting future turbomachinery testing.
