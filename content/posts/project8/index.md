This capstone project, sponsored by Fox Rotating Equipment Solutions, focuses on developing an adjustable diffuser wall for centrifugal compressor testing to reduce lead time and increase aerodynamic testing flexibility. Our team designed a movable diffuser insert capable of varying the wall angle between 0° and 3°, eliminating the need to fabricate new fixed shroud walls for each experiment. My primary contributions involved SolidWorks CAD modeling, motion simulation, and proposing an internal drive ring actuation mechanism to ensure precise and structurally feasible adjustment. Due to sponsor confidentiality requirements, detailed design drawings cannot be publicly disclosed.

## Program Objectives
The goal of this project was to design and develop an adjustable diffuser wall for centrifugal compressor testing that could vary its angle between 0° and 3°. By replacing fixed shroud walls with a movable geometry insert, the project aimed to reduce manufacturing lead time and costs, increase testing flexibility, and enable more efficient aerodynamic experimentation for turbomachinery applications.

## Specific Design Process
Our design process began with identifying the key requirements for a movable diffuser wall, including adjustable geometry (0°–3°), structural stability, and compatibility with instrumentation. We brainstormed multiple actuation methods and selected an internal drive ring mechanism as the most effective solution. Using SolidWorks, I led the CAD modeling and motion simulations to validate the mechanism’s performance, ensuring smooth angle adjustment and durability under operating conditions. The team then refined the geometry for manufacturability and prepared a prototype concept capable of supporting future turbomachinery testing.
